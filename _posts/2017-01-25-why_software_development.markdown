The answer seems to be in the question itself. "Why?" I have always been a curious individual, and that particular question highlights the core fundamental of my being. For better or worse, I can't seem to deviate from a deep rooted urge to always ask why things are they way they are. Or why things can't be different. And while on many occasions, both as a child and an adult, this constant questioning has gotten me into a bit of trouble, it is also the reason behind why I am here today.


**Background**

The son of an IT professional and former Computer Science professor, I was first exposed to computers in the early 90s. Its first and foremost use to me was to play Frogger, Space Cadets, and DOOM (yes, I was probably too young for this, but... oh well). By the time I was four years old, I was fairly profecient with MS-DOS. By six, I had helped my dad repair and build quite a few computers. By eight, I was profecient with MS Office, Internet Explorer, and knew my way around Windows 95/98 like the back of my hand. And by the time I was ten, I had literally seen the inside of every electronic device in the house.


**First Exposure**

My first exposure to software development came in middle school when I decided to join the robotics team. Most every boy and girl in the school was capable of building a functional robot with varying lego pieces, however, that was only half of the equation. Someone has to actually write the programs that told the robot what to do and how to make use of feedback from its varying sensors. And since this was something that no one wanted too or could do (at the time), of course responsibility of getting the robots to work fell on the 6th grade Jr. Captain, me.

It wasn't pretty, but after months of spending time trying to figure out how to make use of the Lego Mindstorm software, I was able to get some semi-functional programs working in time for states. As a first year team, we did, meh..., at best. However, the following year we managed to place, and the year after that, I manager to lead our team to a 1st place finish.


**Software Development as an Adult**

Let's fast-forward fifteen years. My hacking ability to this day has not changed one bit, and has stood my side as I tought myself the fundamentals of web development, print media production, and multimedia content creation. I pride myself on my ability to self-teach and aquire new skills, however, hacking skills increase situational knowledge and really only answer the question, "How?" I have no doubt that I can continue to teach myself new marketable skills and am confident in my ability to learn how to code, but let's go back to the original question, "Why?"

I can teach myself how to accomplish programming tasks, but the reason I am here is to learn why these solutions work in the manner that they do. I believe learning the fundamentals behind these programming languages in a systematic way, will allow me not only to better understand the languages I use, but also increase my productivity and efficiency throughout my coding career.
